# Chess Engine

## Overview
This project aims to develop a chess engine in Java. It provides functionalities to play chess, analyze moves, and test various aspects of the game.

## Testing Guide
To test the chess engine functionalities, follow these steps:

1. **Run the ChessTestKit**: Execute the `ChessTestKit` class to start the interactive CLI-based testing kit.
   
2. **Select Chess Piece**: Choose a chess piece from the list provided. You can select pieces like Bishop, Knight, etc.
   
3. **Specify Piece Color**: Indicate whether the selected piece is black or white.
   
4. **Place the Piece**: Enter the x and y coordinates (0-7) on the chessboard to place the selected piece.
   
5. **Additional Pieces**: Optionally, you can choose to place additional pieces or proceed to the next step.
   
6. **View Piece Path**: After placing the pieces, you can select a chess piece to see its possible moves on the board.
   
7. **Exit**: You can exit the testing kit at any time.

## Current Progress
- Basic implementation for the board and tiles on the board has been completed.
- All pieces have been implemented.
- Currently working on implementing the player and move aspects of the game.

## Upcoming Features
1. **GUI**: Implement a graphical user interface for better user interaction.
2. **Matches against AI**: Develop functionality to play matches against an AI opponent.
3. **2 Player Matches**: Allow players to engage in matches against each other (human vs. human).
